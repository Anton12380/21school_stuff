00:00:05,841 --> 00:00:08,201
Today you'll find out that there are tools,

2
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:10,821
that allow you to script your compilation,

3
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:13,351
thanks to a specific language.

4
00:00:13,607 --> 00:00:16,617
The command <b>make</b> is one of them,

5
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:19,240
although it's not the only tool at your disposal

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,540
I strongly advise you to run a search on

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,650
the internet and check out other tools,

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,562
and why not try and learn how to use them.

9
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:30,658
Anyhow...

10
00:00:30,658 --> 00:00:34,048
Today we're going to focus on <b>make</b> and Makefiles.

11
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:36,931
The command <b>make</b> goes along

12
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:39,257
with one, or several, Makefiles files.

13
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:41,822
Those files will describe, using a set of rules,

14
00:00:41,822 --> 00:00:44,652
how to compile your program.

15
00:00:45,771 --> 00:00:48,501
So, we use the command <b>make</b>

16
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:50,511
which will call the Makefile,

17
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:51,972
read it, and execute it.

18
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,759
A Makefile simply is a file named Makefile

19
00:01:00,621 --> 00:01:03,311
which contains a set of rules

20
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:04,891
as well as some variables

21
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:07,111
that describe the behaviour

22
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:09,151
the compilation must adopt.

23
00:01:09,828 --> 00:01:12,048
Of course, the rules will be able

24
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,570
to call themselves,

25
00:01:13,571 --> 00:01:16,111
and will be able to use variables...

26
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:19,181
The most important thing

27
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:21,311
is to properly structure all of this

28
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:23,161
in order to reach our goal.

29
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:26,031
Let's assume that our Makefile

30
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:28,451
contains the rule <b>clean</b>,

31
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,450
to call this rule, I just have to type :

32
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,594
"make clean" in my terminal.

33
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:39,521
You need to know that all of the rules in a Makefile,

34
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:41,651
are not there to be executed

35
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:43,931
every time we use the command <b>make</b>.

36
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:48,201
Usually, only one rule is executed

37
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:50,852
and its dependencies (we'll see this later)

38
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:52,861
in order to perform the actions

39
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:54,720
this rule was created for.

40
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:59,931
<b>make</b>'s syntax is rather simple,

41
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:02,311
yet very powerful, and we'll discover it

42
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:04,471
in the next part of this course.

43
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:09,241
I'm not saying this lesson on Makefiles

44
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:11,961
will be exhaustive or perfect.

45
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:14,692
I just want to show you the technology

46
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:18,870
and lay the most basic basis

47
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,192
so you can get by,

48
00:02:20,366 --> 00:02:24,346
but you'll learn much more on Makefiles

49
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:28,526
by reading documentation on the internet.

50
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:30,841
See you in the next video.

51
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:34,840
We'll discover the basics of Makefile's syntax

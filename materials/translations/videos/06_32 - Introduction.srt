Hello everyone,

2
00:00:06,641 --> 00:00:10,331
Today we're going to learn a couple of new things.

3
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:14,381
The first thing will be libraries. What are those for?

4
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:17,861
how to create them, but most importantly

5
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:21,261
how will they be useful for this C bootcamp?

6
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:23,901
(and for anything you do later on in C)

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,890
In short, "libraries" are a set of built-in functions,

8
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,520
constants and header files, gathered into one place.

9
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,470
You can create your own libraries to gather useful functions

10
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,800
so you don't have to waste time,

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,350
re-writing them every time you need them.

12
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:43,223
More details to come in the next videos.

13
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:45,773
The second thing we'll talk about,

14
00:00:45,773 --> 00:00:48,413
is how to retrieve a program's arguments.

15
00:00:48,413 --> 00:00:53,743
Up till now, we've been using mains without arguments.

16
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:57,491
But actually we can use mains that take arguments!

17
00:00:57,491 --> 00:01:00,981
That's really useful: it allows us to compile our program just once,

18
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:04,431
instead of having to recompile every time we change something.

19
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:08,761
Therefore it makes your program more efficient.

20
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:13,271
Your program will be conditional,

21
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:15,991
so you won't have to recompile every time you want it

22
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:17,861
to have a different behavior.

23
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:22,741
So let's learn how to retrievea program's argument(s).

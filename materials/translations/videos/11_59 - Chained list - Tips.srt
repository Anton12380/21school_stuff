00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,916
Now that you've seen every thing about

2
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:13,176
chained lists,

3
00:00:13,176 --> 00:00:15,836
Let me give you some tips

4
00:00:15,836 --> 00:00:18,937
There are many ways to write add_link().

5
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:21,445
We can write it like this,

6
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:25,517
with an <b>int</b> to return different error codes, for example,

7
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:29,528
and a double pointer to list as another parameter,

8
00:00:30,348 --> 00:00:34,968
as well as our char *str, to fill up our link.

9
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:41,201
What does this mean?

10
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:46,525
It means that when we'll call our add_link(), from our main,

11
00:00:46,525 --> 00:00:49,091
(let's write add_link())

12
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:55,411
and return the address of 'list',

13
00:00:55,411 --> 00:01:00,371
with, for example, "titi".

14
00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:03,567
If we do this... as we already had a pointer,

15
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:08,545
and send this pointer's address, we get a double pointer.

16
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:12,255
Remember pointers.

17
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:17,201
We know that, for example, if we have an int "i" that's worth 10,

18
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:29,700
we can create an int*, let's say "p", that'll contain the address of "i".

19
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,754
What happens with a double pointer?

20
00:01:36,784 --> 00:01:44,725
We're gonna get an int**, e.g.: "pp", that contains the address of "p".

21
00:01:47,835 --> 00:01:49,012
Meaning...

22
00:01:50,112 --> 00:01:53,252
that the function called, can modify

23
00:01:53,252 --> 00:01:57,081
our pointer's address, in the calling function.

24
00:01:57,901 --> 00:01:59,191
In other words...

25
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:04,371
by erasing all of this, I could simply write:

26
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:08,471
*list = malloc

27
00:02:08,981 --> 00:02:14,490
and so "list" will point towards a valid memory area.

28
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,860
and will be set (initialised) automatically, in your function main().

29
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,100
Good luck.

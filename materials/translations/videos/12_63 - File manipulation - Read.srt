00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:07,505
In this video we'll learn

2
00:00:07,505 --> 00:00:09,170
how to read from a File Descriptor.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,821
We'll use the system call Read,

4
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:12,892
which takes 3 parameters.

5
00:00:12,892 --> 00:00:14,773
The 1st one is the File Descriptor

6
00:00:14,773 --> 00:00:16,083
from which we'll read from,

7
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,974
the 2nd one is the output buffer,

8
00:00:17,974 --> 00:00:20,547
and the last one is the number of bytes needed to read.

9
00:00:20,547 --> 00:00:23,126
Read returns the number of bytes that have been read

10
00:00:23,126 --> 00:00:24,166
or -1 on error.

11
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,940
Here's an example.

12
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:31,499
I've reopened my opening file function.

13
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:33,952
My file '42' is open in read-only mode

14
00:00:34,472 --> 00:00:37,728
I'm gonna set the buffer size to 4096,

15
00:00:39,954 --> 00:00:42,708
create an Int to stock the Read's return

16
00:00:44,568 --> 00:00:47,386
and the buffer, which is static

17
00:00:47,405 --> 00:00:51,127
but you could also create it with Malloc.

18
00:00:53,357 --> 00:00:55,913
Adding a byte... You'll see why.

19
00:01:08,283 --> 00:01:11,806
I ask Read to read 4096 bytes from my file '42'

20
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:13,616
and save them in buff.

21
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:18,807
Don't forget the '\0' at the end of the string.

22
00:01:24,307 --> 00:01:27,307
We're going to print the buffer

23
00:01:30,587 --> 00:01:33,001
and the number of characters that have been read.

24
00:01:38,356 --> 00:01:41,399
Compiling... Launching...

25
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:46,191
The buffer is displayed, I've read 31 bytes

26
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:48,709
much less than 4096.

27
00:01:55,339 --> 00:01:57,939
In some cases, you won't know

28
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:00,044
how many bytes are needed

29
00:02:00,044 --> 00:02:04,283
you'll have to use a loop on Read.

30
00:02:08,343 --> 00:02:11,268
Read returns 0 when it reaches the end of the file,

31
00:02:11,268 --> 00:02:13,790
use this condition for your loop.

32
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,874
Let's set a limit of 10 characters.

33
00:02:39,874 --> 00:02:41,523
The file is 33 characters long...

34
00:02:43,253 --> 00:02:44,855
Recompiling... Relaunching...

35
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:54,614
In each loop, Read returns 10 characters

36
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:57,057
and returns 0 once the last one has been reached.

37
00:02:57,247 --> 00:02:59,353
Then we get out of the loop.

38
00:02:59,824 --> 00:03:03,110
This concludes the part about reading from a File Descriptor.

39
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,743
In the next video, we'll talk about offset.

Hello everyone, 
and welcome to D13 of the C Bootcamp.

2
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:10,642
Today, we're going to talk about
binary trees.

3
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,172
Firstly, I'd like to say that you've lost.
(the game)

4
00:00:13,172 --> 00:00:16,312
and now I'm going to explain
the notions you're going to need

5
00:00:16,312 --> 00:00:17,452
for today's exercises.

6
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:20,772
You have to be comfortable with
pointers to functions,

7
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:22,762
an pointers to structures.

8
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:25,262
Well... if you've understood how chained
lists work,

9
00:00:25,262 --> 00:00:28,622
it'll help, because it's the same
principle, sort of.

10
00:00:28,773 --> 00:00:32,482
First I'll talk about simple
binary trees, which should go

11
00:00:32,482 --> 00:00:36,573
relatively fast, then I'll show you a
more complicated type of

12
00:00:36,573 --> 00:00:39,433
binary trees, that we call
"red-black trees"

00:00:06,192 --> 00:00:06,912
Hello.

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:08,842
In today's first video,

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,082
we'll talk about a preprocessor command,

4
00:00:11,082 --> 00:00:12,232
called "include".

5
00:00:12,232 --> 00:00:14,372
We'll have to add an "#" before it,

6
00:00:14,372 --> 00:00:16,832
because preprocessor commands usually start with <b>#</b>.

7
00:00:16,912 --> 00:00:19,782
This command (include), allows you to include a file

8
00:00:19,782 --> 00:00:22,732
within another file, BEFORE compilation.

9
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:25,492
So, during the preprocessing stage.

10
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:28,872
Let me know you how it works with an example.

11
00:00:29,412 --> 00:00:33,142
Usually, you use the function <b>write()</b>.

12
00:00:33,142 --> 00:00:35,592
If you wanted to use it in your <b>main()</b>,

13
00:00:35,592 --> 00:00:38,003
you had to write the prototype at the top.

14
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:40,683
To know which prototype to use for write()

15
00:00:40,683 --> 00:00:43,743
you had to check its <b>man</b> page

16
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:49,483
and you'd see that write() takes an <b>int</b>, a <b>const void </b>*,

17
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:56,483
a <b>size_t </b>* (which is an unsigned int, you'll see that in a following video),

18
00:00:56,483 --> 00:01:01,303
and a <b>ssize_t</b>, which is an <b>int</b>.

19
00:01:01,303 --> 00:01:06,963
So if I wanted to use write(), I'd have to add its prototype

20
00:01:06,963 --> 00:01:08,933
above my main().

21
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:12,593
In the man, it says "#include <unistd.h>".

22
00:01:13,392 --> 00:01:18,512
That means that write()'s prototype already exists in a file.h,

23
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,992
called "unistd.h".

24
00:01:20,992 --> 00:01:24,582
So instead of writing my prototype and compiling with it,

25
00:01:24,582 --> 00:01:28,582
we'll use a grown-up technique, a real programmer technique,

26
00:01:29,374 --> 00:01:31,144
we'll use <b>include</b>s.

27
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:38,573
So we write "#include", and then <unistd.h>

28
00:01:38,613 --> 00:01:42,853
The angle brackets mean we're getting this file from the PATH...

29
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:46,323
The PATH of the files that the compiler seeks.

30
00:01:46,442 --> 00:01:48,742
You can specify this PATH, based on

31
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,512
the compiler's commands. Up to you to figure out how.

32
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:54,192
There also is another way that allows you

33
00:01:54,192 --> 00:01:58,192
to include files in the present directory : "#include" followed by

34
00:01:58,192 --> 00:01:59,882
the file's name in quotation marks

35
00:01:59,882 --> 00:02:03,812
For example, I could include the file fct.h

36
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,573
What happens when I include unistd.h ?

37
00:02:08,573 --> 00:02:13,213
You'll see. I'm going to try and compile with

38
00:02:13,213 --> 00:02:14,763
-Wall -Wextra -Werror

39
00:02:14,763 --> 00:02:16,033
No problem. No errors.

40
00:02:16,493 --> 00:02:18,893
And here, I can indeed call my function write()

41
00:02:18,893 --> 00:02:21,623
but let me show you what happened exactly.

42
00:02:21,623 --> 00:02:24,463
The preprocessor command is called CPP.

43
00:02:24,463 --> 00:02:27,183
It'll allow us to see what happens

44
00:02:27,183 --> 00:02:29,073
before compilation.

45
00:02:29,073 --> 00:02:30,733
Remember my main.c ?

46
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,193
I'll do a "cat" on it, so you can see.

47
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:35,443
Here. This was my main() with it's "#include"

48
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:37,843
Now, if I show you with CPP,

49
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,343
here's what's been added to it.

50
00:02:42,343 --> 00:02:46,613
All of this, is the unistd.h file, which can include other files.

51
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:49,863
We can clearly see that.

52
00:02:50,442 --> 00:02:53,092
See? There are many prototypes in it.

53
00:02:53,092 --> 00:02:55,492
The prototype for write() is somewhere in there.

54
00:02:56,132 --> 00:02:58,612
This allows us to use the write() function

55
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,732
without having to worry about its prototype.

56
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:03,832
This is incredibly useful, because every time unistd.h is updated,

57
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:06,426
depending on the distribution you're using,

58
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:09,716
you'll be able to include it, and you'll

59
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:13,646
have the correct prototype for write().

60
00:03:13,646 --> 00:03:16,596
What you need to remember from this video,

61
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,106
is that when you do an "#include" of any file,

62
00:03:19,106 --> 00:03:23,556
not necessarily a file.h,

63
00:03:23,556 --> 00:03:26,556
you can include this file and its text directly,

64
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:30,366
before compiling,

65
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:32,396
without processing it.

66
00:03:32,396 --> 00:03:35,756
And then, compilation can happen.

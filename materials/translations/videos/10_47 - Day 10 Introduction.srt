00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,970
Hello, and welcome to this Day 10 of C bootcamp

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,840
I hope that the previous days went well

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,400
and that this one will also be a great success.

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,980
We'll gonna learn various new concepts,

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,850
2 of which in particular : a new tool called <b>Makefile</b>

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,180
that will make your compilations easier

7
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,431
and a new C feature : <b>pointers to functions</b>.

8
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:36,756
which will make your code a little more modular, more interesting.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,750
See you in a bit to talk about <b>Makefile</b>s.

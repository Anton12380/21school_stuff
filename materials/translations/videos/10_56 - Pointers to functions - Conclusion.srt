1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,630
You now know how to use pointers to functions in C.

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,440
What you need to understand is that the goal isn't to

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,110
make you use pointers to functions everywhere,

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,410
or any old how.

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,740
Pointers to functions are for specific cases

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,810
which you'll learn to identify

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,060
with experience.

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,060
I strongly advise you to do some research on the internet

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,730
and find other ways to exploit this notion.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,660
The Internet holds many examples and tutorials, and everything

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,220
you could possibly need to master this notion.

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,190
I really strongly advise you to do so, because pointers to functions

13
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,920
is a notion you'll come across a lot, later on,

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,630
under a slightly different shape, when you'll learn C++,

15
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,330
and we'll see that it's a notion at the center of many problems,

16
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,280
and that needs to be mastered.

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,010
So it's important to start right away,

18
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,400
by understanding how to use pointers to functions,

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,990
and know what they truly conceal.

20
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,320
But that's your responsibility, so good luck for today's exercises

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,891
and see you very soon for another video.

22
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:06,341
Goodbye.

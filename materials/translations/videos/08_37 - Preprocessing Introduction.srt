Hello, and welcome to D08 of the C bootcamp.

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,940
Today we're going to talk about the preprocessor.

3
00:00:11,002 --> 00:00:14,312
In D07's last video, you've learnt about the stages of compilation.

4
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,104
The first stage being the preprocessor,

5
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:21,314
the second being the compilation of files.c, and then you saw 'linkage'.

6
00:00:22,936 --> 00:00:27,556
The preprocessor will allow you to generate code,

7
00:00:27,556 --> 00:00:30,846
and set defines for what we call macros.

8
00:00:30,846 --> 00:00:33,386
You've probably heard of those. In Excel, perhaps.

9
00:00:33,386 --> 00:00:36,850
And that'll also allow you to protect you files from multiple inclusions.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,920
And we'll end these videos with structures :

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,380
a new way to 'package' data, 

12
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,540
as well as "typedef" which will allow you to create your own types of variables.

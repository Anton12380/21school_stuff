Hello everyone,

2
00:00:07,988 --> 00:00:09,858
and welcome to d04 of C Bootcamp.

3
00:00:09,858 --> 00:00:11,678
Today's topic: Recursion.

4
00:00:11,853 --> 00:00:13,693
Recursion is a programming concept

5
00:00:13,693 --> 00:00:17,123
that might seem strange at first for some of you.

6
00:00:17,123 --> 00:00:19,543
But we'll divide this lesson into two parts.

7
00:00:19,543 --> 00:00:21,423
First part: Theory:

8
00:00:21,423 --> 00:00:25,213
What is it and how will it change my life?

9
00:00:25,213 --> 00:00:27,434
but most importantly, why should I care about recursion?

10
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:29,714
and then, second part, Practice:

11
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:33,034
We'll check out a mathematical example first,

12
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:34,684
then in real code.

13
00:00:34,684 --> 00:00:36,914
To see how it works in real life.

14
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:40,954
make sure, before starting this lesson,

15
00:00:40,954 --> 00:00:45,204
that you really understand how functions work:

16
00:00:45,204 --> 00:00:46,974
how to call a function,

17
00:00:46,974 --> 00:00:48,534
how to pass it parameters,

18
00:00:48,534 --> 00:00:50,464
how to make it return values,

19
00:00:50,464 --> 00:00:52,064
how it's evaluated, etc...

20
00:00:52,064 --> 00:00:53,524
If you didn't get these facts,

21
00:00:53,524 --> 00:00:55,084
I strongly advise you to revise

22
00:00:55,084 --> 00:00:57,173
these notions before starting these videos.

23
00:00:57,173 --> 00:00:58,923
Otherwise, you might get lost,

24
00:00:58,923 --> 00:01:00,520
and end up wasting your time.

25
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,060
Let's get started.

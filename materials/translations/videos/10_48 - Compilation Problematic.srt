1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,760
So far, you've always compiled

2
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:10,891
your C sources using GCC

3
00:00:11,015 --> 00:00:12,565
from your terminal.

4
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:16,191
You were writing lines like : "gcc [source file name].c",

5
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:18,370
in this case: source.c

6
00:00:18,731 --> 00:00:21,331
which compiled your program

7
00:00:21,411 --> 00:00:23,351
to an executable called "a.out".

8
00:00:23,411 --> 00:00:25,501
We've seen that we could also, queue files,

9
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:27,221
when we have multiple sources,

10
00:00:27,351 --> 00:00:29,281
or use *.c to compile them all

11
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,182
and generate the same a.out.

12
00:00:31,312 --> 00:00:34,362
Perhaps some of you use the option "-o"

13
00:00:34,532 --> 00:00:36,436
to specify a program's name,

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,390
here, for example, "-o awesomeprog" which is created from source.c

15
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,450
and now we have our executable "awesomeprog"

16
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:47,601
which is next to our previous executable "a.out".

17
00:00:48,861 --> 00:00:53,351
What you need to understand is that GCC is a complex compiler

18
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,530
and you must take the time to really understand how it works

19
00:00:57,618 --> 00:00:59,598
and get to know its options.

20
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:04,361
The sooner you'll do this, the sooner you'll be comfortable with the compiler

21
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:06,931
and able to fully take advantage of it.

22
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:10,901
Gradually, as you learn how to use GCC,

23
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:13,071
you'll realize that this compiler

24
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:16,101
has very complex options, and sometimes,

25
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:19,111
if we want to use separate compilation,

26
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:23,391
or set tasks before and after compilation,

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,400
or add "include" directories, or libraries... Who knows!

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,319
compilation lines in the terminal can become really complicated.

29
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:35,299
And soon, we realise that we're gonna need a Shell script to organise it all.

30
00:01:35,842 --> 00:01:38,052
In the first part of this course

31
00:01:38,052 --> 00:01:41,181
we'll discover a new tool called Makefile

32
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:46,061
which will allow us to solve this problem efficiently,

33
00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:48,618
and do exactly what we want.
